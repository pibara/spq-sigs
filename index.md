## CoinZdense

This is the project page for the combined CoinZdense projects. The CoinZdense projects aim to provide simple post-quantum-ready hash-based signatures geared specifically at :

* utility blockchain projects
* distributed exchange projects
* other blockchain projects that are commonly used in a key-reuse by design way.

CoinZdense explicitly does NOT aim at being a post-quantum solution for blockchain projects that neither rely nor would benefit from extensive re-usage of signing keys.

### Projects

There are currently two active projects in CoinZdense. One for Python and one for C++. The ultimate goal of the project though is to support a number of different programming languages.

* [C++](http://cpp.coin.z-den.se/)
* [Python](http://python.coin.z-den.se/)
* [JavaScript](http://js.coin.z-den.se/)
* [Monte](http://monte.coin.z-den.se/)
* [Rust](http://rust.coin.z-den.se/)
* [Clojure](http://clojure.coin.z-den.se)
* Elixir
